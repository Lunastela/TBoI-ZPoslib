ZPosLib Thought Gathering

To fix the collision type problems maybe introduce a flag that changes the kind of collision types that are provided?
Always try to set the collision type to the type it was set to the last frame if it isn't the one forcibly being changed.
It's okay to (partly) reimplement grid collisions in some way or form because nobody can actually change how they work unless repentogon adds
something for that, though they would add a way to check I believe.
